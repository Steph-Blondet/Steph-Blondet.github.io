# PROJECT #1: CONNECT FOUR GAME

For my first project at General Assembly's Full Stack Web Development program, I had to create a Connect Four game from scratch. I used HTML and CSS to lay out the board, buttons and tokens. I used JavaScript and jQuery to make it interactive and functional.

- No installation is required to play this game. The game will load as soon as the page loads.
- The game will start with the teal token.
- The user will have to click on the 'play here' buttons to add a token to an empty space.
- The game will switch from teal to blue every time the 'play here' button is clicked.
- The first user to have 4 tokens in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- The game will announce the winner with a message.
- To start a new game, the user will have to click on the 'new game' button. This will clear the tokens from the board and it will remove
the winner announcement.

Unsolved problems: The 'new game' button is working (meaning that it removes the tokens from the board and it clears the message where it
says the turn), but the user can't play again after the button has been clicked.

Solved but needs more work: I wrote the code for all the winning conditions (horizontal, vertical and diagonal) but I didn't use a for loop. This creates a long function that I would like to revise to make the code cleaner and DRY.

Overall Comments: The game is working and exceeds the minimum requirements for the project!
