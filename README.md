PROJECT #1: CONNECT FOUR GAME

For my first project at General Assembly, I had to create a Connect Four from scratch. I used HTML and CSS to layout the board, buttons
and tokens. I used JavaScript and jQuery to make it interactive and functional.

- No installation is required to play this game. The game will load as soon as the page loads.
- The game will start with the teal token.
- The user will have to click on the 'play here' buttons to add a token to an empty space.
- The game will switch from teal to blue every time the 'play here' button is clicked.
- The first user to have 4 tokens in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- The game will announce the winner with a message.
- To start a new game, the user will have to click on the 'new game' button. This will clear the tokens from the board and it will remove
the winner announcement.

Unsolved problems: The 'new game' button is working (meaning that it removes the tokens from the board and it clears the message where it
says the turn), but I can't play again after the button has been clicked.

Solved but needs more work: I wrote the code for all the winning conditions (horizontal, vertical and diagonal) but I didn't use a for loop. This creates a long function that I would like to revise to make the code cleaner and DRY.
